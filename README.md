# Algorithms learning project

This project dedicated to algorithms learning. 

Repository contains (or will contain) some basic, dummy implementation of data structures, algorithms, approaches and related practicing; also there are a lot of related notes, theory, comments which describe obvious things etc. Code could be a little bit dirty, simple and not optimized very well, yet it created to understand theory and play around it. 

## Topics included
1. Algorithm complexity computation, Big O;
2. Data Structures;
3. Algorithms;


## Structure
Consists of directories which correspond each topic, directories contain modules corresponding to particular subject.
